                Hi, my name is Geyang, a penultimate student. I am currently an ANU student studying Computer Science. Being enthusiastic at writing program, I usually spend most of my leisure time writing some software and games. In particularly, I like writing html5 game even though most of the people claim that they can make more money by writing apple or android games.

                Other than that, one of my passions is drinking tea. There are countless types of tea in China; however, the Oolong tea is the sole types of tea that manage to capture my attention. The name oolong tea came into the English language from the Chinese name, means “black dragon”. It is also called the Wuyi rock tea, which is a special kind of tea that only grows in Wuyi Mountains, locating in the northern Fujian, China.  Moreover, out of so many different subvariety of Oolong tea, the tea that I like the most is the Narcissus. It may not be as famous as the other kind of tea, such as the Dragon Well, the Spring Snails and the Yellow Mountain Fur Peak.  However, for me, it is definitely the kind of tea that manage to reveals and fits my personality - talented but low-profile.

                To me, drinking tea is not just about drinking a kind of soft drinks. It represents my attitude towards my life. Besides, there are so many benefits for those who drink tea. Tea contains antioxidant, which protect our body from ravages of aging and the effects of pollution. It may also reduces the risk of heart attack and stroke. Besides, it also helps to bolster our immune system. To sum up, drinking tea brings more pros than cons to us. Opps, to correct the misleading notion here, it brings pros and no cons to us.
